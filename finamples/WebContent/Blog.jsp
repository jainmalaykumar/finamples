	<h3>How to Invest in Paper Gold in India?</h3>
	Gold has always been a preferred investment option for Indians. It is a
	highly liquid asset and has the potential to generate good returns in
	the long term. However, holding gold in physical form has many
	drawbacks. The safety of holding gold in physical form is one of the
	main concerns. To overcome the risks of holding gold physically, you
	may invest in paper gold in India.
	<br> Different Ways to Invest in Paper Gold in India  Gold
	Electronic Traded Funds (ETFs)
	<br>One of the ways on investing in paper gold is through Gold
	ETFs. Purchasing Gold ETFs units is similar to purchasing stocks on the
	stock exchange. These units are available at the current market price
	of gold. These units can be traded on the commodity exchange. You can
	purchase these ETF units through lump sum investment or via SIP at
	regular intervals.  Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) If you are planning to
	purchase paper gold you can invest in Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs).
	These bonds are issued by the Reserve Bank of India and they come with
	a sovereign guarantee. An individual can purchase these bonds when the
	window opens for a particular time interval. The window for the
	purchase of SGBs usually opens once in 2-3 months. If an individual
	wishes to buy SGBs outside this window, they may purchase them from the
	secondary market.  Gold Mutual Funds 0One of the ways to purchase
	paper gold is by investing in gold mutual funds. These funds invest in
	gold ETFs and are managed by professional fund managers.
	<br>0 This investment will help you in diversifying your portfolio
	and reduce the overall risk.  Digital Gold You can now make an online
	purchase of gold coins, jewellery or bars. The process of buying gold
	online is similar to buying physical gold. The purchase made by you
	will be stored in a digital locker that you can access anytime using
	digital platforms. You can buy or sell gold digitally using those
	platforms. Digital gold makes gold accessible and solves the problem of
	physical storage. The above mentioned are some of the ways through
	which you may invest in paper gold in India.
	<br>Before investing in any of the options, one must think
	carefully.
	<br> For example, SGBs are useful for long-term investors, while
	Gold ETFs offer better liquidity in comparison to SGBs. One more
	important criterion that investors must consider while investing in
	gold is taxation on gains.
	<br> For example, gains made from SGBs are exempt from taxation in
	case of redemption, but in Gold ETFs, the long-term capital gain is
	applicable at the rate of 20% after indexation. Therefore, make your
	gold investment decisions wisely and after considering various
	investment goals.
