		<h3>Sterlite Industries(Vedanta)</h3>
		<p>Vedanta (then called Sterlite industries) began in the 1980s,
			as the founder D.P.Agarwal founded Sterlite Industries (India)
			Limited in Mumbai and begun to buy mining concessions in different
			states of India. He was soon joined by his two sons, Navin Agarwal
			and Sunil Agarwal, both of whom currently run the company. In 1992,
			they established Volcan investments in Nassau (Bahamas) as the main
			holding company for their mines.[5] D.P.Agarwal had a small aluminium
			conductor business in Patna. His son Anil Agarwal had come to Mumbai
			to expand their business.[6] In the 1990s, as the Indian government
			began to sell off sick (non-performing) companies, Sterlite began to
			bid for them. They were able to bid successfully for BALCO and
			Hindustan Zinc Limited, both bankrupt companies that had been closed
			down for 4 years. Meanwhile, in January 1993, D. P. Agarwal founded
			Twinstar Holdings Limited in Mauritius, which was mostly owned by
			Volcan investments. On 26 May 2002, the Enforcement Directorate filed
			a show cause notice with Sterlite, relating to the six-year period
			between 1993 and 1999 when Twinstar acquired the shares of Sterlite
			and various investment companies – such as Dwarka Prasad Anil Kumar
			Investments Private Limited, Pravin Navin Investment & Trading
			Private Limited and Sterlite Copper Rolling Mills Private Limited –
			which, in turn, had made substantial investments in Sterlite and
			another group company, Madras Aluminium Company Limited (MALCO) after
			obtaining permission from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). On 29
			April 1999, many of these investment companies were liquidated and
			all the shares of Sterlite came back to Twinstar's possession.
			Twinstar became the 100% owner of shares in these investment
			companies and received government approvals from the RBI as well as
			the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB).[5] On 8 December 1999,
			officials of the Income Tax department raided the offices of Sterlite
			located at Dhanraj Mahal, Apollo Bunder and Tulsiani Chambers,
			Mumbai, and seized many documents. The IT department then decided to
			engage the services of ED officials as it appeared that there could
			have been a violation of the country's foreign exchange laws. After
			analyzing these documents, the ED inferred that Twinstar was
			incorporated with the sole intention of acquiring an interest in
			Sterlite. The Directorate alleged that the Agarwals, before
			liquidating the shares of the investment companies mentioned, had
			written off loans worth 230 million and made an agreement to gift
			their overseas corporate body, Twinstar, a sum of ₹338 million
			including shares of Sterlite worth ₹72 million. Between 1993 and
			1999, Sterlite and its investment companies allegedly brought in
			₹2.08 billion to India through Twinstar to subscribe to the shares of
			Sterlite and make investments in the company.[7][5] Sesa Goa – Scambi
			(1954–1963) The company today known as Sesa Goa was founded in 1954,
			as Scambi Economici SA Goa.[8] Since then, it gradually grew to
			become a large low-cost producer of iron ore. During 1991–1995, it
			diversified into the manufacture of pig iron and metallurgical coke.
			Scambi Economici Societa Anonyma (SESA), owned by Baron Ludovic
			Toeplitz, with the financial backing of Alessandro Vassalo, obtained
			the Orasso Dongor mining lease in Sirsaim, Goa in 1954 and Sesa Goa
			Limited was formed. It was bought over in 1955, with equal
			shareholding, by Gewerkeshaft Exploration e Bergbau and Ferromin
			S.p.A., a subsidiary of Finsider S.p.A. (of IRI group), which
			eventually acquired the other half stake in 1963. Sesa Goa
			(1963–2007) Sesa Goa Limited was incorporated as a private limited
			company in 1963 under The Companies Act, 1956. In 1979, Sesa Goa
			Private Limited was formed, with the merger of Sesa Goa Limited with
			another mining company in Goa, Mingoa Sociedade Miniera Goesa
			S.a.r.l. By 1965, Sesa Goa and Mingoa were incorporated as a private
			limited company under The Companies Act, 1956. The merger happened in
			1979 and the new, unified company was called 'Sesa Goa Pvt Ltd'. The
			company went public in 1981[9] with 42,000 Indian shareholders,
			holding 60% of its shares and the remaining 40% held by Finsider
			International, which later became ILVA International. Sesa Goa had
			started with iron mining as its core business but slowly, it ventured
			into barge construction in 1984 at Sirsaim, located in the Bardez
			taluka of North Goa. Since then, the barge construction unit has been
			developed into a shipbuilding division.[10] In the 1990s, Sesa Goa
			began further expansion, aided by an influx of foreign investment
			during the economic liberalization of India enforced by the World
			Bank and IMF. In 1992, the first phase of a 150,000 ton pig iron
			plant was commissioned. In the same year, Sesa introduced India's
			first low-phosphorus foundry grade pig iron in India and subsequently
			formalised the business under pig iron division. The pig iron plant
			was located at Amona, Goa and had an annual production capacity of
			250,000 tonnes per annum. Other alliances were formed in the
			nineties—in January 1995, Sesa Shipping was launched by acquiring a
			transhipper M.V. Orissa. The year also saw the inclusion of 84 new
			coke ovens. When Mitsui & Co. of Japan bought Finsider International
			in 1996, it gained 51% stake in Sesa Go. By 1997, Sesa Kembla became
			a 100% subsidiary of Sesa Goa. In 1997, A Narrain mines located in
			Chitradurga, (Karnataka) were purchased. A Supreme Court directive in
			August 2011 led to suspension of mining activities in the region. In
			1999, Sesa Goa started mining operations in Barbil, which has the
			fifth largest deposit of iron ore and manganese in the world. They
			started producing iron ore which was exported from the port towns of
			Haldia and Paradip. During this time, the company also started the
			Sesa Community Development Foundation that supported the NCM Sesa
			Technical School and a football academy called SESA F.A. During the
			end of the 90s, the company also began to consolidate through mergers
			and acquisitions. Sesa Kembla completed the creation of an indigenous
			and environment-friendly technology that produced high-quality
			metallurgical coke. This technology generated power[11] as a
			by-product.[12] In 2003, the Sesa Goa equity in Sesa Industries was
			raised to 88.25%, impacting the shareholding pattern. Take over by
			Vedanta (2007) In 2007, Vedanta Resources Plc, a diversified metals
			and mining group founded by Anil Agarwal, acquired 51% controlling
			stake[13] in Sesa Goa Ltd. from Mitsui & Co. Ltd. Vedanta Resources
			is listed on the London Stock Exchange and a constituent of FTSE 100
			Index. The deal was worth ₹40.7 billion (US$510 million), making it
			the largest M&A deal in the industry so far.[14] In 2009, Sesa Goa
			acquired Goa-based Dempo Group's mining and maritime businesses for
			₹17.5 billion (US$220 million) in an all-cash deal.[15][16] This was
			the second largest[17] acquisition in India's iron-ore industry, and
			it gave Sesa Goa access to Dempo's 70 million tons of iron-ore
			mineable resources in Goa. In 2011, Sesa Goa purchased 51% stake in
			Western Cluster, Liberia for $90 million.[18] The Liberia Gola Forest
			Community people who also suffered from the civil war believe that
			the coming of Western Cluster will help to alleviate their suffering
			and provide employment. In 2007, it became a majority-owned
			subsidiary[19] of Vedanta Resources Plc, listed on the London Stock
			Exchange, when Vedanta acquired 51% controlling stake from Mitsui &
			Co., Ltd. In June 2009, Sesa Goa Limited acquired[15] VS Dempo & Co.
			Private Limited (now Sesa Resources Limited) along with its fully
			owned subsidiary Dempo Mining Corporation (now Vedanta Limited) and
			50% equity in Goa Maritime Private Limited. In 2010, Vedanta acquired
			the zinc assets of British miner Anglo American plc. In 2011 Vedanta
			Resources bought 58.5% controlling stake in Cairn India, India's
			largest private sector oil & gas company.[20] In 2015, Sterlite
			Industries and Sesa Goa announced their merger and finally merged
			into a single entity in August 2015.[21] In 2015, Sesa Sterlite
			changed its name to Vedanta Limited.[22] On 11 April 2017, Cairn
			India merged with Vedanta Limited to consolidate its position as one
			of the largest diversified natural resources companies in the
			world.[23] In 2018 Vedanta Limited acquired control of Electrosteels
			Steels Limited.[24] Electrosteel Steels had been constructing an
			integrated steel plant at Siyaljori in Jharkhand.</p>

		<h2>Technical Analysis</h2>
		<img alt="Error" src="tech.jpg"
			style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
		<h3>Trendlines in Technical Analysis</h3>
		Since price patterns are identified using a series of lines or curves,
		it is helpful to understand trendlines and know how to draw them.
		Trendlines help technical analysts spot support and resistance areas
		on a price chart. Trendlines are straight lines drawn on a chart by
		connecting a series of descending peaks (highs) or ascending troughs
		(lows). A trendline that angles up, or an up trendline, occurs where
		prices are experiencing higher highs and higher lows. The up trendline
		is drawn by connecting the ascending lows. Conversely, a trendline
		that is angled down, called a down trendline, occurs where prices are
		experiencing lower highs and lower lows. Trendlines will vary
		depending on what part of the price bar is used to "connect the dots."

		While there are different schools of thought regarding which part of
		the price bar should be used, the body of the candle bar—and not the
		thin wicks above and below the candle body—often represents where the
		majority of price action has occurred and therefore may provide a more
		accurate point on which to draw the trendline, especially on intraday
		charts where "outliers" (data points that fall well outside the
		"normal" range) may exist. On daily charts, chartists often use
		closing prices, rather than highs or lows, to draw trendlines since
		the closing prices represent the traders and investors willing to hold
		a position overnight or over a weekend or market holiday. Trendlines
		with three or more points are generally more valid than those based on
		only two points. Uptrends occur when prices are making higher highs
		and higher lows. Up trendlines connect at least two of the lows and
		show support levels below price. Downtrends occur when prices are
		making lower highs and lower lows. Down trendlines connect at least
		two of the highs and indicate resistance levels above the price.
		Consolidation, or a sideways market, occurs where price oscillates in
		a range between two parallel and often horizontal trendlines. Types of
		Stock Chart Patterns A price pattern that denotes a temporary
		interruption of an existing trend is a continuation pattern.

		Continuation Patterns A continuation pattern can be considered a pause
		during a prevailing trend. This is when the bulls catch their breath
		during an uptrend or when the bears relax for a moment during a
		downtrend. While a price pattern is forming, there is no way to tell
		if the trend will continue or reverse. As such, careful attention must
		be placed on the trendlines used to draw the price pattern and whether
		the price breaks above or below the continuation zone. Technical
		analysts typically recommend assuming a trend will continue until it
		is confirmed that it has reversed.
